# Scripts Goodies

#### Hey all :)
#### Sometimes I find myself deep diving online to find Bash scripts that I need.
#### Here, in Scripts-Goodies repo, I will try to publish my Bash script that I create on a daily basis as a DevOps.
#### I made some of the scripts by myself, some of them I find online, and restructure them in a way that suits me.
